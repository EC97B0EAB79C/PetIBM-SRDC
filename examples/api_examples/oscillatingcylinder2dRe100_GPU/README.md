# 2D flow around inline oscillating cylinder (Re=100, KC=5)

## Build the example

Build procedure is the same to the basic API example, `liddrivencavity2d`. Here we just give the commands:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DPETIBM_DIR=${CONDA_PREFIX} ../
$ make all -j $(nproc)
```

The executable `oscillatingcylinder` will be available in the `build` folder (i.e., the current folder).

If you're interested, in the `CMakeLists.txt`, we also link against `libpetibmapps.so` using the imported target `petibm::petibmapps`.
We do so because `oscillatingcylinder` is a solver derived from the `RigidKinematicsSolver` solver class.
It is the major difference between `oscillatingcylinder` and the `liddrivencavity2d` example.

## Run the example

You can run the example (for example, using 4 MPI processes and 1 GPU device) with

```shell
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<idx1>
mpiexec -np 4 oscillatingcylinder -options_left -log_view ascii:view.log
```
`<idx1>` denotes the IDs of the GPU to be used (if there are more than one GPU on your systems).

The simulation should complete in less than 40 minutes when using:

* 2 CPU processes (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz),
* 2 NVIDIA K20 GPU devices.

And it should complete in around 16 minutes when using

* 6 CPU cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8174 CPU @ 3.10GHz)
* 1 NVIDIA V100 (32GB variant)

Note, if MPI was installed using `conda`/`mamba`, then you may need to add the flag `--mca opal_cuda_support 1`, i.e., `mpiexec -np 4 --mca opal_cuda_support 1 ...`.
This is due to that the Anaconda's OpenMPI package disables the CUDA support by default.

## Post-processing

Plot the drag coefficient over 4 oscillation cycles:

```shell
python scripts/plotDragCoefficient.py
```

The Python script will display the Matplotlib figure and save it into the sub-folder `figures` in the simulation directory.

Compute the vorticity field at saved time steps:

```shell
petibm-vorticity
```

Create XDMF files to visualize the data with VisIt:

```shell
petibm-createxdmf
```

The XDMF files `p.xmf` (pressure), `u.xmf` (x-velocity), `v.xmf` (y-velocity),
and `wz.xmf` (vorticity) are saved in the simulation directory and can be used
as input files to visualize data with VisIt.
